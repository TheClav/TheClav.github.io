            &ldquo;I supervised Calvin DeBellis during his internship at Ataccama in the summer of 2025. Throughout his time with us, Calvin demonstrated strong technical and analytical skills. He was able to take on a complex topic, break it down into manageable parts, and systematically work through each step. He approached his work with autonomy, clear communication of progress, and was not afraid to ask thoughtful and relevant questions when needed. Calvin successfully handled several technical challenges, including configuring our environments, connecting to cloud services, writing python scripts to extract data necessary for the project, and performing fine-tuning and evaluation of large language models in an agenting framework. He consistently delivered high-quality work with minimal supervision. Beyond his technical abilities and problem-solving mindset, I would like to emphasize Calvin's soft skills. He actively integrated into the team. He regularly attended team meetings, sought out opportunities to learn, provided constructive feedback, and wasn't afraid to suggest improvements &mdash; all of which were appreciated by the team. Overall, I enjoyed the cooperation with Calvin and it exceeded my expectations. Thus I can recommend him for any future academic or professional opportunities.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;I had the pleasure of managing Calvin during his summer internship at Instructure in 2024. During this time, he played a pivotal role in developing our new Marketing Media Mix model, which uses data science to determine optimal budget allocations across various marketing channels. Calvin took full ownership of this project, demonstrating exceptional initiative and technical skill. He worked directly with stakeholders at Instructure and a third-party company to define the scope of work and project requirements. He independently led meetings, showcasing impressive leadership abilities. Calvin was solely responsible for collecting and organizing data, skillfully setting up queries to consolidate all relevant information into a comprehensive table within our data warehouse. His attention to detail and methodical approach ensured that the data was not only accurate but also readily accessible for analysis. One of Calvin's standout contributions was his ability to troubleshoot issues as they arose. He identified a cumbersome manual process that was hindering our efficiency and successfully devised a solution using Python to automate it. This significantly improved the timeliness and accuracy of our data collection, enhancing the overall effectiveness of our Marketing Media Mix model. Calvin's analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and dedication to excellence made him an invaluable asset to our team. I have no doubt that he will bring the same level of commitment and expertise to any future role and will be a tremendous asset to any organization.&rdquo;
